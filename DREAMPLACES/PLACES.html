				<h3>Paris, France</h3>
				<p>Paris the city of lights. Its a popular tourist destination for anyone who doesn't live in Europe.
				I do want to visit it one day because I want to experience the rich culture and rich food that France has.
				Aside from the food and culture, some of the nice landmarks as well as its rich artworks
				and fashion that France has would also be nice to visit.</p>

				<h3>Shinjuku, Japan</h3>
				<p>Japan, one of the most technologically advance countries in the world.
				Being a big fan of japanese media and culture, it would be pretty understandable why I would like to visit it.
				One of my most wanted place to go to in Japan is Golden Gai, in Shinjuku, its infamous for being
				being a alley way with many different small bars located in there. I want to go see it one day 
				just because the place radiates a energy similar to the cyberpunk aesthetic. Aside from that I do want to exprience
				the entirety of Japan one day. I do like its sceneries, architecture, culture, and so much more.

				<h3>Iceland</h3>
				<p>Iceland a place with more greenery than ice, which is ironic given its name.
				I'd like to visit Iceland for its natural beauty.
				From what I have heard and saw online, Iceland is quite a beautiful place to visit.
				I has many scenic view around its nature.
				Lastly the nortern lights can be seen in Iceland which would be nice to observe.</p>

				<h3>Berlin, Germany</h3>
				<p>Germany, the land of beer and bread. 
				I'd like to visit Germany not just because of its beer and bread.
				A reason on why I would like to visit it is because of its rich history.
				From its WW2 history to the Berlin Wall, I'd like to learn more about it when I get the chance to visit Germany.
				Germany's arts and scenic landscapes would also be nice to see.
				The Rhine River is one of the places that I want to see in Germany.</p>

				<h3>Australia</h3>
				<p>Australia, "A country thats on hardmode" a quote from somewhere that I heard in the internet.
				Being filled with many deadly animals, Australia might be not that pleasing to visit.
				In all honesty one of the reason why I do want to visit Australia one day is due to that,
				aside from having many deadly animals, Australia just has a lot of animals in general.
				Seeing a diverse ecosystem of animals is quite nice.
				Also Australia has a lot of kind and happy people.
				From what I have learned from the internet, Australian people tend to be more chill and jolly.
				Going off of that those are the reasons why I do want to visit Australia one day.
				Due to its people and animals.</p>
